    <h1>About me</h1>    
    <p>
        I am a 5th semester Computer Science student at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (GGSIPU), Rohini Sec-22. I am a Front-end Web Developer currently exploring software development. What sets me apart is my drive to constantly explore new possibilities and embrace challenges. I am learning Java, Python and various other tools for full stack development. I am always eager to learn and never afraid to experiment.
